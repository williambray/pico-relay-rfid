# Pico Relay RFID Project Code

This repo contains the code for both the Pico Microcontroller and the Raspberry Pi Web Server (Not the Swift Application however) for my first ever Pico project.

Each folder will walk you through the setup and installation for both the Pico and the RPi Web Sever

### Project Info

Project time: ~1 day.

Started as just a project with the Pico, an RFID reader and a relay for a simple actiation once a tag was recongnised by the reader. Ended up grabbing the spare Raspberry Pi 4 I had laying around and thought why not try extend the project to take an input from a request on a websever running on the pi. So that's how we got here.
